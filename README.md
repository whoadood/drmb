## Optimizations

<!-- optimization plans -->

While I think prompting users for full descriptions for sections of the readme seems a bit unwieldy for the command line, I do believe there is a happy medium not yet reached, prompting for more accurate details would be a nice to have.

With multiple template options it would be good quality of life to have a set of prompts that work across all templates, however, I think it will have to be fleshed out with specific set of prompts for each template.

## Lessons Learned

<!-- a few paragraphs about project learnings -->

I have been dealing with imposter syndrome a lot lately and it was suggested to me to tinker around in node making command line interfaces. After revisiting how the event loop works, a lot of node documentation and a handful of tutorials I have made the first project that makes me feel like a programmer. Blocking / non-blocking, synchronous / asynchronus, call stack / queue, cant say that I know a whole lot more about them than I did, but there's definitely an improvement. ðŸ¤·
